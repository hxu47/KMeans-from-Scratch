# kmeans
This project is aimed to implement clustering algorithms including kmeans, kmeans++ and spectral clustering from scratch and explore their application.  
Main notebook is [kmeans.ipynb](https://github.com/hxu47/kmeans/blob/main/kmeans.ipynb).  
PDF version is [kmeans.pdf](https://github.com/hxu47/kmeans/blob/main/kmeans.pdf).  
Algorithms implemented from scratch are defined in [kmeans.py](https://github.com/hxu47/kmeans/blob/main/kmeans.py).
